### Software Required

# Getting Python
Getting the latest version of python, at the time of writing this was 3.8.5 but 3.6 will be released soon - from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

```sh
$ python 3.9
$ print ("hello World")
```
# Online Flowchart / Diagram Creator
Copies of visio are available from azure - however I think that this website makes life a lot easier: https://app.diagrams.net/
 
 I have not tested things out yet but you can install the desktop version from here https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases/tag/v13.7.3
